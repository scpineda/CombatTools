# Combat Tools

This application was made in Flutter.

## General Introduction

Dungeons and Dragons and other Tabletop games are often very slow to play. Between rolling, mental math, counting that math against MORE math, the complications of the game often start to compound. 

Comabat Tools is a tool that can be used by player and DM alike to make combat smoother. There are five tools available.

#### Hit Calculator
Is that AC too hard for you to hit? You don't need to guess anymore. Simply put it in the creature's AC and your Hit mod (full) to see whether or not you are able to hit easily. If the number is towards the high or low end, that's a good indiciator that the DM is up to something... use this information to strategize.

#### Save Calculator
In the same way, you can check either your own or the creature's chances to make a Spell Save DC. Like the Hit calculator, put in the Spell DC and Mod(full) to see the chances. 

#### Concentration Calculator
If you are a spellcaster or are fighting a particularly nasty mage, quick Concentration Checks are a must. But the rules can sometimes give you a hard time as to what the save is. This calcualtor makes it easy and quick to tell you what the Con Save will be.

#### Dice Roller
Most Dice Rollers will be a simply 1d6 or 1d20-- not this one. This Dice Roller can roll multiple dice at once (4d6, for example) and add in your modifier (4d6+10)! 

#### Stats Roller
Need a quick stats roller for a one-shot or NPC? There are three ways to roll stats: Standard 3d6, 4d6 and dropping the lowest one, and 4d6, dropping lowest and rerolling all ones.
